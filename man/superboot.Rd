\title{Bootstrap Resampling for Statistical Estimates with Enhanced Plotting}
\usage{
superboot(
  iter = 10000,
  x,
  fun = "mean",
  alpha = 0.05,
  cx = 1.5,
  plotType = "histogram",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{The number of bootstrap iterations to perform, defaults to 10,000.}

\item{x}{A numeric vector of data points from which to bootstrap.}

\item{fun}{The function to apply to each bootstrap sample. Supported functions
include 'mean', 'median', etc., or any user-defined function that takes
a numeric vector and returns a single value. Defaults to 'mean'.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level used to calculate the confidence intervals,
defaults to 0.05.}

\item{cx}{Expansion coefficient for text in plots, defaults to 1.5.}

\item{plotType}{Type of plot to display the bootstrap statistics. Supported types
are "histogram" and "density". Defaults to "histogram".}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters to pass to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing the computed confidence intervals,
        the function used for computation, and the original data vector.
}
\description{
This function performs bootstrap resampling to estimate the distribution of a statistic
and its confidence intervals and provides options for visualizing the results using
enhanced graphical representations. The function supports various plot types including
histograms and density plots.
