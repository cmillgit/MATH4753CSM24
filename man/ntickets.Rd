\title{Plane Ticket Sales Optimization}
\usage{
ntickets(N = 200, gamma = 0.02, p = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{the number of seats on the flight}

\item{gamma}{the probability of overbooking (i.e, P(s > N) where s = total number of people with tickets who show up)}

\item{p}{the probability that a person with a ticket shows up for the flight}
}
\value{
Returns descriptive plots and prints the optimal tickets sold (both discrete and continuous)
}
\description{
This function computes the optimal number of plane tickets to sell to prevent overbooking beyond a specified probability, using discrete binomial and normal distribution approximations. It generates comparative plots for each approach, pinpointing the ticket quantity where the likelihood of overbooking is just below the acceptable threshold.
